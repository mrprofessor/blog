Named after my cat, Phoebe is an imperative programming language based
on the semantics defined by Michael J. C. Gordon in [[https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4612-6228-2][The Denotational
Description of Programming Languages]]. The language is implemented in
Haskell, mirroring the semantics described in the book.
