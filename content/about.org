#+TITLE: About
#+author: rkar

I build expansive and scalable web applications at work. At home, I
aspire to create tiny, useful applications â€“ the kind that don't
require a second mortgage to host.

If your idea captures my interest, I am willing to dedicate a few
hours a week to software consulting. For full-time opportunities,
I'd need something truly compelling to make the leap.

Got questions about my articles? Found a bug in my code snippets? Or
maybe you just want to debate vim vs emacs? Drop a comment or shoot me
an email at ~contact[at]rkar.org~. I read everything, even the spam.
